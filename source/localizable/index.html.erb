      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>Simple is an app that helps improve hypertension control and prevent heart attacks and strokes by making it easy for healthcare workers to manage blood pressure (BP) measurements and medications. A web-based Simple dashboard gives health system managers the feedback they need to improve BP control across their facilities.</p>

      <h3>Where is it?</h3>
      <p>Simple is deployed in more than 400 facilities in India and is used to manage over 100,000 patients with hypertension. <a href="/about">Learn more</a> about deployments. Simple will expand to more countries in 2019-2020.</p>
