        The fast, free app for clinicians to track patients with hypertension.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What is Simple?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In many places, patient records for blood pressure measurements are unusable for longitudinal care. A simple, focused tracking system, coupled with a simple and effective treatment protocol, will help clinicians to save patients’ lives.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Where did this project start?
      </h3>
      <p>
          Simple is supported by <a href="https://www.resolvetosavelives.org">Resolve to Save Lives</a>, an initiative of the not-for-profit <a href="https://www.vitalstrategies.org/">Vital Strategies</a>, which aims to reduce the number of people dying from heart disease and stroke in low- and  middle-income countries. A key goal is to dramatically increase the percentage of people with hypertension who have their blood pressure measured and controlled. Simple, contextual digital platforms for tracking hypertension are essential, enabling actionable reporting and improved patient management.
      </p>

    <h3>What’s the roadmap?</h3>
    <p>We are at an early stage. Prototypes of an app were tested in Punjab with the <a href="http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=173938">India Hypertension Management Initiative</a> (IHMI) in April 2018 and we are close to testing a <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.simple.clinic">minimum viable product</a> in the field in July.</p>
    <p>We can envision a future where, working closely with ministries of health, in appropriate situations this app will be used in clinical care settings. Robust reporting tools will be built to track clinic and regional control of hypertension. And we are likely to create tools to help patients track their personal blood pressures.
      That said, it’s early days and we will be guided by lessons learned on the ground and by guidance from all of those involved in the project.</p>

    <h3>Is Simple starting an open source community?</h3>
    <p>We are looking forward to establishing an open source community that includes designers, developers, implementers, heatlh care workers, and patients. More information will be coming through this year. In the meantime, GitHub is the center for contributions.</p>
      
    <h3>Thanks</h3>
    <p>This project relies on excellent advice and participation from the partners of Resolve to Save Lives, the Government of India, the Government of Punjab, and countless clinical workers, patients, and colleagues who put in the hard work every day to improve the control of hypertension around the world.</p>
