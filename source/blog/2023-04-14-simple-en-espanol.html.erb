<section>
  <p>Just a couple of weeks ago, we got a request from several countries in Latin America to trial Simple. Great! But, Simple isn't available in Spanish. So, we put out a call to the community and asked for help translating Simple into Spanish. The response was tremendous.</p>
  <p>Over just one week, a team of volunteers answered our call and translated the app into Spanish. The app has 1,143 strings (words or phrases) that need to be translated. Volunteers were able to log into our translation tool, <a href="https://transifex.com/">Transifex</a>, and work through the strings. We gathered in a <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> channel to discuss challenging translations and were able to ask some Spanish-speaking doctors for help where medical terminology was especially important.</p>
