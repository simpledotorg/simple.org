  whatQ: "What is Simple?"
  whatA: "A simple management system, together with a simple and effective hypertension treatment protocol, will help clinicians to save patients' lives. The Simple app is a purpose-built tool: quickly create a longitudinal record of your patients' blood pressures and hypertension medications."
