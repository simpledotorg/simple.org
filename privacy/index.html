        <h3>How We Store and Protect Your Data</h3>
        <p>Vital Strategies uses commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to help ensure and
        demonstrate that your personal information is safe from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure,
        alteration or destruction. These measures shall be reviewed and updated when necessary.
        Vital Strategies stores all of your data on servers located outside the European Union. Vital Strategies has a
        layered security in our systems and only designated employees have access to copies of your personal
        information. All online transactions are done on a secure server. This means that information entered on the
        transaction page is encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) before transmission. On secure pages, a
        &quot;closed&quot; lock symbol is displayed in the bottom part of your browser screen and the website address in the
        address bar at the top of the browser screen starts with an &quot;https&quot; instead of an &quot;http&quot;.
        We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow
        such persons to provide us with their personal information without parent or guardian consent.</p>

        <h3>Data Sharing and Data Transfers</h3>
        <p>Vital Strategies does not sell your data to third parties or give it to third parties without your consent, with the
        exception of sharing or transferring your data to our international offices, Vital Strategies’ affiliate offices, or
        Vital Strategies’ affiliate organization The Union. Vital Strategies only shares information with our affiliates or
        international offices as necessary and will not share any information with an affiliate or international office until
        an agreement or MOU is in place between Vital Strategies and the affiliate or international office with explicit
        provisions to preserve confidentiality of shared data.</p>

        <h3>Accessing Your Information</h3>
        <p>Any individual who makes a request is entitled to be told whether any personal data is being stored and
        receive a description of the personal data, the reasons it is being stored, and whether it will be given to any
        other organizations or people. You have the right to obtain from us confirmation of whether we are processing
        personal data concerning you, as well as the purposes of such processing, the categories of data being
        processed, and other information related to the use and storage of your data. Requests for confirmation should
        be made to us in writing via <a href="mailto:datainquires@vitalstrategies.org">datainquires@vitalstrategies.org</a>.</p>

        <p>Vital Strategies will also give you a copy of data and the source of data about you upon request and after
        verification of your identity. You also may ask us to stop storing your personal data, and we will accommodate your request unless the data is necessary to achieve the purposes for which you provided it (e.g. processing
        your donation) or it is otherwise required for legitimate legal or business purposes. You also have a right to ask
        for a copy of the information we hold about you. If there are any discrepancies in the information we provide,
        please let us know and we will correct them.</p>

        <p>If you would like to access your data, please send a description of the information you would like to see and
