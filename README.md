# Simple.org

This repository houses the source code for the [Simple.org](https://www.simple.org/) website.

## Development

### Setup

We use [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) to build the static pages which are hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

To run the site on your own machine, simply clone the repo, install the packages necessary, and start up a Middleman server.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:resolvetosavelives/simple.org.git
$ cd simple.org
$ bundle install
$ middleman server
```

If you see an error with middleman, 'Unknown command middleman' then try:

```
$ bundle exec middleman
```

OR

```
$ bundle exec middleman server
```

### Deployment

After merging your commits to `master` and pulling the latest, run `rake publish`.

### Common deployment errors

**Error:** `src refspec gh-pages does not match any`

1. Run `git pull origin master`
2. Run `git fetch`
3. Run `rm -rf build` to delete your `build/` directory
4. Run `rake publish`

**Error:** `Could not find middleman-blog-4.0.3 in any of the sources`

1. Make sure you have the proper ruby version installed. **Note:** If you're using `rvm`, run `rvm use 2.5.1` to use Ruby version 2.5.1.
2. Run `rm -rf build` to delete your `build/` directory
3. Run `rake publish`

## Contribute

### Add a new contributor to Simple.org

To add a new contributor to [simple.org/about](https://simple.org/about), do the following:

1. Add a contributor item to `data/contributors.yml`
2. Open `locales/en.yml` for a list of available roles and countries. **Note:** Please make sure the string you set in `contributors.yml` exactly matches the key in the `en.yml` file. Otherwise the role/country will display an error.
3. Make sure the contributor is properly displayed in your local
4. Merge and deploy (if you have deployment issues, check "Deployment" section below)

> Contributors are listed **alphabetically** by **last name**

### Create a new blog article

To add a new blog article, do the following:

1. **Create a new branch:** Pull the lastest from master and create a new branch.
2. **Create a new file:** Add a new file in `source/blog/` using the following extension and naming convention: `year-month-day-my-new-article.html.erb`.
3. **Paste front-matter:** Open an old article in `source/blog/` and copy and paste the front-matter content to your new article.
4. **Update front-matter:** Update the front-matter variables with your content. **Note:** Make sure to wrap all variable content within `" "`.
5. **Set an author:** If the article's author is a contributor listed in `data/contributors/yml`, make sure to add their exact name in the `author` variable. If the author isn't a contributor, follow the "Add a new contributor to Simple.org" instructions above before proceeding.
6. **Add article images:** Add your article images in `/images/blog/my-new-article/`.
7. **Image placeholders:** Re-export your images with a width of `50px` and a Figma layer blur of `1`. Image placeholders are used to lazy-load images and reduce initial page load times.
8. **Create your content:** Use an existing article for reference to properly format and structure your article's content. There are no wrapping `div`s around the contentâ€”it's just a bunch of `section`s and image `div`s!
9. **Merge to master:** Check your article in your local on small and large devices. Once it's ready merge into master.
10. **Publish your article:** Follow the instructions in the "Deployment" section above to publish your new article.
11. **Optimse any images:** Head to [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) and minimise all images used in the blog post for faster loading. _It will minimise both png and jpg_ files in the same drop zone.
