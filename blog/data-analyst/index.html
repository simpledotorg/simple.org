  <h2>
    About you
  </h2>
  <p>
    We are seeking an experienced candidate who is ready to do work that matters. No one will be productive on day one, nor do we expect you to. Instead, we’re looking for someone who embraces learning about our challenges, has solved plenty of related problems, and can work effectively with our remote team.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Mindset
  </h3>
  <p>
    We try hard to be a team full of empathy, inclusion, and respect. We trust each other, have hard conversations with open mindedness, and assume positive intent. We document as much as possible, work as asynchronously as possible, and meet via video conference when necessary. Proposing ideas and trying new things are paramount; always being right is not. We are frequently wrong and try to write code that we don’t mind deleting when we learn new things. We’re excited for you to participate and look forward to helping you grow your own skills as well.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Diversity
  </h3>
  <p>
    Given that we’re writing software for the globe, it’s critical that our team represent the diverse environments in which we operate. We strive for an inclusive, diverse team with different perspectives, ideas, and identities.
  </p>
